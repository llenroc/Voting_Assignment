A fairly new addition to the\nofficial specification, the Notification API allows modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE 9+ to push\nnotifications to a user's desktop. Push acts as a cross-browser solution to this API, falling back to use  older\nimplementations if the user's browser does not support the new API.\n\nYou can quickly install Push via [npm](http://npmjs.com):\n\n```\nnpm install push.js --save\n```\n\nOr, if you want something a little more lightweight, you can give [Bower](http://bower.io) a try:\n\n```\nbower install push.js --save\n```\n\nFor more information regarding the Push NPM package, [see here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/push.js).\n\n#### Creating Notifications ####\nSo just how easy is it to create a notification using Push? We can do it in just one line, actually:\n\n```javascript\nPush.create('Hello World!')\n```\n\nNo constructors, just a universal API you can access from anywhere. Push is even compatible with AMD as well:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['pushjs'], function (Push) {\n   Push.create('Hello World!');\n});\n```\n\nIf the browser does not have permission to send push notifications, Push will automatically request permission as soon\nas create() is called. Simple as that. If you wish to know how many notifications are currently open, simply call:\n\n```javascript\nPush.count();\n```\n\n#### Closing Notifications ####\nWhen it comes to closing notifications, you have a few options. You can either set a timeout (see \"Options\"), call\nPush's close() method, or pass around the notification's promise object and then call close() directly. Push's close()\nmethod will only work with newer browsers, taking in a notification's unique tag name and closing the first notification\nit finds with that tag:\n\n```javascript\nPush.create('Hello World!', {\n    tag: 'foo'\n});\n\n// Somewhere later in your code...\n\nPush.close('foo');\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can assign the notification promise returned by Push to a variable and close it directly using the\npromise's then() method:\n\n```javascript\nvar promise = Push.create('Hello World!');\n\n// Somewhere later in your code...\n\npromise.then(function(notification) {\n    notification.close();\n});\n```\n\nWhen it comes to clearing all open notifications, that's just as easy as well:\n\n```javascript\nPush.clear();\n```\n\n**Important:** Although Javascript promises are [decently supported](http://caniuse.com/#search=promises) across\nbrowsers, there are still some browsers that lack support. If you find that you are trying to support a browser that\ndoesn't support promises, chances are it won't support notifications either. However, if you are really determined, I\nencourage you to checkout the lightweight [promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill) library\nby Taylor Hakes (or something similar). This library used to be bundled with Push, until it was decided that it'd be\nbetter to leave that sort of dependency to the user's discretion.\n\n### Permissions ###\nWhile Push automatically requests permissions before displaying a notification, you may sometimes wish to either\nmanually request permission or view whether or not Push already has received permission to show notifications.\nPush uses an array of constants to keep track of its current permission level. These constants are as follows:\n\n```javascript\nPush.Permission.DEFAULT; // 'default'\nPush.Permission.GRANTED; // 'granted'\nPush.Permission.DENIED; // 'denied'\n```\n\n#### Requesting Permission ####\n\nTo manually request notification permission, simply call:\n\n```javascript\nPush.Permission.request(onGranted, onDenied);\n```\n\nwhere `onGranted` is a callback function for if permision is granted, and `onDenied` is a callback function for if, you\nguessed it, the permission is denied. Note that if `Permission.DEFAULT` is returned, no callback is executed.\n\n#### Reading Permission ####\n\nTo find out whether or not Push has permission to show notifications, just call:\n\n```javascript\nPush.Permission.has();\n```\n\nwhich will return a boolean value denoting permission.\n\n#### Native Permission Levels ####\n\nIf you feel like being *really* geeky, you can get the raw permission level from native API itself (scary stuff, I know)\nusing:\n\n```javascript\nPush.Permission.get();\n```\n\nThis returns a string value which may or may not coincidentally be represented by Push's constants. Use this info as you\nplease.\n\n### Options ###\n\nThe only required argument in a Push call is a title. However, that doesn't mean you can't add a little something extra.\nYou can pass in options to Push as well, like so:\n\n```javascript\nPush.create('Hello World!', {\n    body: 'This is some body content!',\n    icon: {\n        x16: 'images/icon-x16.png',\n        x32: 'images/icon-x32.png'\n    },\n    timeout: 5000\n});\n```\n\n#### Available Options ####\n\n* __body__: The body text of the notification.\n* __data__: Data to pass to ServiceWorker notifications\n* __icon__: Can be either the URL to an icon image or an array containing 16x16 and 32x32 pixel icon images (see above).\n* __link__: A relative URL path to navigate to when the user clicks on the notification on mobile (e.g. if you want users to navigate to your page `http://example.com/page`, then the relative URL is just `page`). If the page is already open in the background, then the browser window will automatically become focused. Requires the `serviceWorker.js` file to be present on your server to work.\n* __onClick__: Callback to execute when the notification is clicked.\n* __onClose__: Callback to execute when the notification is closed (obsolete).\n* __onError__: Callback to execute when if the notification throws an error.\n* __onShow__: Callback to execute when the notification is shown (obsolete).\n* __requireInteraction__: When set to true, the notification will not close unless the user manually closes or clicks on it.\n* __serviceWorker__: Path to the [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/push-notifications/step-03?hl=en) script registered on Push mobile. Defaults to \"serviceWorker.js\" if a path is not specified.\n* __tag__: Unique tag used to identify the notification. Can be used to later close the notification manually.\n* __timeout__: Time in milliseconds until the notification closes automatically.\n* __vibrate__: An array of durations for a mobile device receiving the notification to vibrate. For example, [200, 100] would vibrate first for 200 milliseconds, pause, then continue for 100 milliseconds. For more information, see below.\n\n#### Mobile Support ####\n\nPush can be used on Android Chrome (apparently Safari on iOS does not have notification support), but the website in\nwhich it is running on ***must*** use have a valid SSL certificate (HTTPS only!!) otherwise it will not work. This is\ndue to Google's\n[decision to drop the Notification constructor](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/BygptYClroM)\nfrom mobile Chrome. Sucks but hey, that's life, am I right?\n\n### Development ###\n\nIf you feel like this library is your jam and you want to contribute (or you think I'm an idiot who missed something),\ncheck out Push's neat [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how you can make your mark.\n\n### Credits ###\nPush is based off work the following work:\n\n1.
