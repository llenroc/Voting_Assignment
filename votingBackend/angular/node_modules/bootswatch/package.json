  "readme": "Bootswatch\n==========\n\n[![Bootswatch Logo](./assets/img/logo-dark.png)](http://bootswatch.com)\n\nBootswatch is a collection of open source themes for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).\n\nUsage\n-----\nDownload the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet. You must still include Bootstrap's JavaScript file to have functional dropdowns, modals, etc.\n\nThe themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/). \n\nYou can import a theme into your styles using either LESS or SASS.\n\nLESS:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less\";\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/variables.less\";\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/bootswatch.less\";\n\n```\n\nSASS:\n\n```\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap\";\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/bootswatch\";\n\n```\n\n\nCustomization\n------\nBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.\n\nEach theme consists of two LESS files. `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize [these settings](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables). `bootswatch.less` introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nThese files are also available in SASS.\n\nCheck out the [Help page](http://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.\n\nAPI\n-----\n\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch. More info at http://bootswatch.com/help/#api\n\nContributing\n-----\nIt's through your contributions that Bootswatch will continue to improve. You can contribute in several ways.\n\n**Issues:** Provide a detailed report of any bugs you encounter and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/issues).\n\n**Documentation:** If you'd like to fix a typo or beef up the docs, you can fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.\n\n**Code:** Make a fix and submit it as a pull request. When making changes, it's important to keep the CSS, LESS and SASS versions in sync. To do this, be sure to edit the LESS source files for the particular theme, then run the  tasks `grunt swatch` and `grunt:convert_less` to build the CSS and LESS.\n\n**Donation:** Donations are gratefully accepted via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=F22JEM3Q78JC2) and [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/bootswatch/).\n\nAuthor\n------\nThomas Park\n\n+ http://github.com/thomaspark\n+ http://thomaspark.co\n\nThanks\n------\n[Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).\n\n[Jenil Gogari](http://www.jgog.in/) for his contributions to the Flatly theme.\n\n[James Taylor](https://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\n\n[Corey Sewell](https://github.com/cjsewell) for SASS conversion.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n----\nCopyright 2014-2016 Thomas Park\n\nCode released under the MIT License.\n",
